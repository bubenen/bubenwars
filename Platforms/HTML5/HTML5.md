# UE4 HTML5 Platform Extension

HTML5 platform support has been migrated to GitHub as a community-supported Platform Extension and no longer officially supported by Epic in upcoming releases.

HTML5 uses the [Emscripten Toolchain](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html#emscripten-toolchain) from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) to cross-compile C++ into Javascript.

## Content Development

When building content aimed at the HTML5 platform, you can use the guidelines for creating mobile-oriented content as many of the restrictions for mobile development are applicable to HTML5 development.
