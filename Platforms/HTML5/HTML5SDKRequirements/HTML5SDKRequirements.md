# HTML5 Development Requirements

In this page you'll find hardware and software development kit (SDK) requirements needed to start developing for the [HTML5](../HTML5.md) platform.

- You can find the currently supported SDK version(s) in the `HTML5SDKInfo.cs` file. You can find it in your `Engine/Platforms/HTML5/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/` folder.

### Special: HTML5's Unreal Engine 4.24.3

Note: Epic LOCKS down toolchains on all `major.minor` updates.
They do not allow SDK version numbers to change during `major.minor.patch` updates.

But, since HTML5 is community driven and emscription DOES NOT lock down the version numbers
of TOOLS used (i.e. can be incremented at will -- again, this is the tools used -- not to
be confused with emscripten itself), there are periods of time when upgrading the toolchain
will become possible.  In this case, for UE 4.24.3, emscripten 1.39.18 is possible.
